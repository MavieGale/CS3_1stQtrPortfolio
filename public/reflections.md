# Q1 End of Lessons Reflections
#### by Mavie Gale Cruz, 9 - Beryllium

### 5 Topics That I Know Very Well
1. **Week 2 - Server-side Web Development** - The first topic that I know very well is ofcourse, the setting up of the **Github Profile, and VsCode Portfolio.** This was done during the Week 1 of the Quarter, and we were taught the basic tools, such as forking, how to change the branch to the main, and inviting collaborators. We also learned how to do Markdown! since it was needed for the SONA bonus.
2. **Week 3 - Differet Types of Variables** - The second topic that I also know is **how to declare variables properly.** Starting from Grade 7 we were already taught how to name variables appropiately, even though it was in Python it still applied to other programming languages like HTML and Javascript. In this lessson we were also taught the three types of variables that we can use for Javascript, one is the *var* where you can reassign the value of the variables, and you can use it before declaring it within the code *(also called "var hoisting").* Similar to *var* is *let*, but we cannot redeclare it, because it will give you a SyntaxError. And lastl is *const*, where the function or variable within the same scope cannot have the same name as the variable 
3. **Week 3 - Different Data Types** - At the same week, we also recalled the different data types, which are the *strings*, *numbers*, *boolean*, *undefined*, *null*, and *symbol*. Although this lesson was taught to us back in Grade 7, there were new things that we could do o them in JS. One is using the concat function, where there is a new string returned, it can be done using the *document.write(variable.concat(Value));*. And second, is the template literals, where we use the *backtick (``) character. 
4. **Week 3 - Arithmetic Operators** - These re the operators that has an input of numeric values, and outputs numeric values as well. Examples of these operators are *addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and laslty, increment and decrement(post and pre).*
5. **Week 5 - If Else and Switch Loop Structures** - This lesson was a great recall to me, and I really feel confident in using these loop structures because it was taught to us since Grade 7, and we were greatly practiced in using these during Grade 8. 

### 5 Topics That I Need Further Practice/Discussion

1. **Input/Output Statements** - I think I need more practice on this topic, especially that the discussion of this topic felt really fast paced for me, and I needed more time on processing and understanding this topic. I needed more time to understand this because unlike from the previous programming languanges, this was user-interactable, and more on "servers". 
2. **Button Function** - This as well, the topic felt really fast, and too quick for me to understand fully. I wasn't able to do the bonus activities for this lesson because I couldn't understand how to do it. I kind of understand it now because I used w3schools, and took my time. 
3. **Client-side Javascript** - I think I was a bit confused how to reference the Javascript in the HTML file because it's a really tedious process, and you need to switch back to different types. 
4. **HTML Elements** - I mostly don't understand that much the topics in HTML, because we are mainly practicing JS, and sometimes I forget the things in HTML, especially .getAttribute(), and .innerHTML. 
5. **HTML Events** - I don't think we were able to dicuss this properly in class yet, but it's also related to the Button function, so I think I need more understanding on this as well.

### My Plan of Action
>I will try to make more time in practicing for certain topics that I do not understand on that day, using other resources aside from w3schools and Khub. And I will also try to consult more to our teacher, either with a classmate or not.  

### Activities that I Found Effective
- **Graded Exercise 2 to 6** - I found these activities really helpful because they allow us to use whatever we learned for that week and it also recalls us the basic things that we need to look out for.
- **Kahoot** - Even though I'm never on the podium, the questions in the Kahoot help a lot for conceptual type of questions in the exam, and especially the arithmetic operators. They help a lot in recalling the basic things, and at the same time they help in answering the hard questions in the exam.


### Activities that I Did Not Find Effective
- **Speed Test** - I know that for most people, they found this effective as it tests how fast you can actually understand things, and it trains you to work fast, but for me, it makes it harder. It makes it harder because I feel the need to rush my code.
- **Graded Exercise 7** - I think a lot of people had a hard time answering this, especially me, since it was the first time we needed to debug something like this, and you really need to look per line.
